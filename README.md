# Pozo Demo

Here we demonstrate pozo-py's features and show off our roadmap for future
development.

This is where we:

1. Run integration tests across several different environments.
2. Build our public [roadmap document](www.geopozo.com/roadmap).
3. Allow users to suggest features in
   [issues](https://github.com/geopozo/pozo-demo/issues).

Once a suggest feature is added to the demo, we close it the issue.

The [main repository](https://github.com/geopozo/pozo-py) is a better place to
report bugs that need to be fixed.

Thank you!
