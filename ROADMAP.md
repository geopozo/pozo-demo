# Roadmap

We're going to have a notebook file that we sort of render as a test. And then
we're going to convert it to marimo, and also render it as a test. And then we
have to render it again under pyodide.

So we can just start with that in the basic environment just for development,
whatever we want to install, a messy environment.

Now each command will be run, I guess, with a deps array (probably generated and
parameterized)
