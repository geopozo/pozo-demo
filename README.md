# Pozo Demo

Pozo Demo functions as a demonstration of GeoPozo's open source capabilities as
well as a ROADMAP for future development.

This repository is used to

1. Test pozo-py across several different environments
2. Provide our public [roadmap document](www.geopozo.com/roadmap)
3. Allow users to suggest features in [issues](https://github.com/geopozo/pozo-demo/issues)

Once we've decided to incorporate the issue into our roadmap, we close it and
add it to the demo- failing or not.

The [main repository](https://github.com/geopozo/pozo-py) is a better place to
report bugs that need to be fixed.

Thank you!
